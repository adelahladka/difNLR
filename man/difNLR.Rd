\description{
Performs DIF detection procedure based on Non-Linear Regression model (generalized logistic
regression) and either likelihood-ratio or F test of submodel.
}
\details{
DIF detection procedure based on Non-Linear Regression is the extension of Logistic Regression
procedure (Swaminathan and Rogers, 1990).

The \code{Data} is a matrix whose rows represents scored examinee answers ("1" correct,
"0" incorrect) and columns correspond to the items. In addition, \code{Data} can hold
the vector of group membership. If so, \code{group} is a column indicator of \code{Data}.
Otherwise, \code{group} must be either a vector of the same length as \code{nrow(Data)}.

The unconstrained form of 4PL generalized logistic regression model for probability of correct answer (i.e., y = 1) is
P(y = 1) = (c + cDif*g) + (d + dDif*g - c - cDif*g)/(1 + exp(-(a + aDif*g)*(x - b - bDif*g))),
where x is standardized total score (also called Z-score) and g is group membership. Parameters a, b, c and d
are discrimination, difficulty, guessing and inattention. Parameters aDif, bDif, cDif and dDif
then represetn differences between two groups in discrimination, difficulty, guessing and inattention.

This 4PL model can be further constrained by \code{model} and \code{constraints} arguments.
The arguments \code{model} and \code{constraints} can be also combined.

The \code{model} argument offers several predefined models. The options are as follows:
\code{Rasch} for 1PL model with discrimination parameter fixed on value 1 for both groups,
\code{1PL} for 1PL model with discrimination parameter fixed for both groups,
\code{2PL} for logistic regression model,
\code{3PLcg} for 3PL model with fixed guessing for both groups,
\code{3PLdg} for 3PL model with fixed inattention for both groups,
\code{3PLc} (alternatively also \code{3PL}) for 3PL regression model with guessing parameter,
\code{3PLd} for 3PL model with inattention parameter,
\code{4PLcgdg} for 4PL model with fixed guessing and inattention parameter for both groups,
\code{4PLcgd} (alternatively also \code{4PLd}) for 4PL model with fixed guessing for both groups,
\code{4PLcdg} (alternatively also \code{4PLc}) for 4PL model with fixed inattention for both groups,
or \code{4PL} for 4PL model.

The \code{model} can be specified in more detail with \code{constraints} argument which specifies what
arguments should be fixed for both groups. For example, choice \code{"ad"} means that discrimination (a) and
inattention (d) are fixed for both groups and other parameters (b and c) are not.

The \code{type} corresponds to type of DIF to be tested. Possible values are
\code{"both"} to detect any DIF caused by difference in difficulty or discrimination (i.e., uniform and/or non-uniform),
\code{"udif"} to detect only uniform DIF (i.e., difference in difficulty b),
\code{"nudif"} to detect only non-uniform DIF (i.e., difference in discrimination a), or
\code{"all"} to detect DIF caused by difference caused by any parameter that can differed between groups. The \code{type}
of DIF can be also specified in more detail by using combination of parameters a, b, c and d. For example, with an option
\code{"c"} for 4PL model only the difference in parameter c is tested.

Argument \code{match} represents the matching criterion. It can be either the standardized test score (default, \code{"zscore"}),
total test score (\code{"score"}), or any other continuous or discrete variable of the same length as number of observations
in \code{Data}. Matching criterion is used in \code{NLR()} function as a covariate in non-linear regression model.

A set of anchor items (DIF free) can be specified through the \code{anchor} argument. It need to be a vector of either
item names (as specified in column names of \code{Data}) or item identifiers (integers specifying the column number).
In case anchor items are provided, only these items are used to compute matching criterion \code{match}. If the \code{match}
argument is not either \code{"zscore"} or \code{"score"}, \code{anchor} argument is ignored. When anchor items are
provided, purification is not applied.

The \code{p.adjust.method} is a character for \code{p.adjust()} function from the \code{stats}
package. Possible values are \code{"holm"}, \code{"hochberg"}, \code{"hommel"},
\code{"bonferroni"}, \code{"BH"}, \code{"BY"}, \code{"fdr"}, \code{"none"}.

The \code{start} is a matrix with a number of rows equal to number of items and with 8 columns.
First 4 columns represent parameters (a, b, c, d) of generalized logistic regression model
for reference group. Last 4 columns represent differences of parameters (aDif, bDif, cDif, dDif)
of generalized logistic regression model between reference and focal group. If not specified, starting
values are calculated with \code{startNLR()} function.

The output of the difNLR is displayed by the \code{print.difNLR()} function.


Fitted values are extracted by the \code{fitted.difNLR()} function for item(s) specified in
\code{item} argument.

Predicted values are produced by the \code{predict.difNLR()} function for item(s) specified in
\code{item} argument. \code{score} represents standardized total score of new subject and
\code{group} argument represents group membership of new subject.

Missing values are allowed but discarded for item estimation. They must be coded as
\code{NA} for both, \code{data} and \code{group} parameters.

In case that model considers difference in guessing or inattention parameter, the different parameterization is
used and parameters with standard errors are recalculated by delta method. However, covariance matrices stick with
alternative parameterization.
