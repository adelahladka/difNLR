\details{
DIF detection procedure based on Non-Linear Regression is the extension
of Logistic Regression procedure (Swaminathan and Rogers, 1990).

The \code{Data} is a matrix whose rows represents examinee scored answers
("1" correct, "0" incorrect) and columns correspond to the items.
The \code{group} must be a vector of the same length as \code{nrow(data)}.

The options of \code{model} are as follows: \code{Rasch} for one-parameter logistic model with
discrimination parameter fixed on value 1 for both groups, \code{1PL} for one-parameter logistic
model with discrimination parameter fixed for both groups, \code{2PL} for logistic regression model,
\code{3PLcg} for three-parameter logistic regression model with fixed guessing for both groups,
\code{3PLdg} for three-parameter logistic regression model with fixed inattention for both groups,
\code{3PLc} and \code{3PL} for three-parameter logistic regression model with guessing parameter,
\code{3PLd} for three-parameter logistic regression model with inattention parameter,
\code{4PLcgdg} for four-parameter logistic regression model with fixed guessing and inattention
parameter for both groups,
\code{4PLcg} for four-parameter logistic regression model with fixed guessing for both groups,
\code{4PLdg} for four-parameter logistic regression model with fixed inattention for both groups, or
\code{4PL} for four-parameter logistic regression model.
The \code{type} corresponds to type of DIF to be tested. Possible values
are \code{"both"} to detect any DIF (uniform and/or non-uniform), \code{"udif"}
to detect only uniform DIF or \code{"nudif"} to detect only non-uniform DIF.

The \code{start} is a matrix with a number of rows equal to number of items and with 8 columns.
First 4 columns represent parameters (a, b, c, d) of generalized logistic regression model
for reference group. Last 4 columns represent differences of parameters (aDif, bDif, cDif, dDif)
of generalized logistic regression model between reference and focal group. If \code{start}
missing, starting values are calculated by \code{startNLR()} function.

The \code{p.adjust.method} is a character for \code{p.adjust} function from the
\code{stats} package. Possible values are \code{"holm"}, \code{"hochberg"},
\code{"hommel"}, \code{"bonferroni"}, \code{"BH"}, \code{"BY"}, \code{"fdr"},
\code{"none"}.

Missing values are allowed but discarded for item estimation. They must be coded
as \code{NA} for both, \code{data} and \code{group} parameters.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# loading data based on GMAT
data(GMAT)

data  <- GMAT[, colnames(GMAT) != "group"]
group <- GMAT[, "group"]
# Testing both DIF effects using F test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction (default)
NLR(Data, group)

# Testing both DIF effects using likelihood-ratio test
NLR(Data, group, test = "LR")

# Testing both DIF effects with none multiple comparison correction
NLR(Data, group, type = "both", p.adjust.method = "none")

# Testing uniform DIF effects
NLR(Data, group, type = "udif")
# Testing non-uniform DIF effects
NLR(Data, group, type = "nudif")
