First two items were considered to function differently in uniform and non-uniform way respectively. The data set represents responses of 1,000 subjects to multiple-choice test of 20 items. A correct answer is coded as 1 and incorrect answer as 0. The column \\code{group} represents group membership, where 0 represents reference group and 1 represents focal group. Groups are the same size (i.e. 500 per group).\n#'\n#' @usage data(GMAT2)\n#'\n#' @author\n#' Adela Drabinova \\cr\n#' Institute of Computer Science, The Czech Academy of Sciences \\cr\n#' Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University \\cr\n#' adela.drabinova@gmail.com \\cr\n#'\n#' Patricia Martinkova \\cr\n#' Institute of Computer Science, The Czech Academy of Sciences \\cr\n#' martinkova@cs.cas.cz \\cr\n#'\n#' Karel Zvara \\cr\n#' Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University \\cr\n#'\n#' @references\n#' Kingston, N., Leary, L., and Wightman, L.
