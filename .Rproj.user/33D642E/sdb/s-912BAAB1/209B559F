S3 method\n     'coef' was created.\n\n  o  New functions NLR() and constrNLR() can now calculates DIF\n     detection statistics and specify constraints for generalized\n     logistic regression model.\n\n  o  Function 'difNLR()' was edited to response to 'difR' package\n     and its DIF detection functions.\n\n  o  Function 'genNLR()' was changed to generate dataset from\n     generalized logistic regression model with 8 parameters.\n\n\n\nMINOR UPDATES\n\n  o  The CITATION file was updated.\n\n  o  Several typos were fixed.\n\n  o  Some default options of input were changed.\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n- Changes in difNLR 0.2.0 (2016-11-09) -\n----------------------------------------\n\nMAJOR UPDATES\n\n  o S3 method 'plot' for class 'difNLR' was updated.\n\n  o New option of 'test' in 'difNLR()' function was added. Possible\n    choices are now 'F' for F-test and 'LR' for likelihood ratio test.\n\n  o Choice of significant level 'alpha' was added into 'difNLR()'\n    function with default option 0.05.\n\n  o Six new data sets were added - scored 'GMAT' data, its unscored version\n    'GMATtest' and its key 'GMATkey'. Scored 'difMedical' data set, its\n    unscored version 'difMedicaltest' and key 'difMedicalkey'.\n\n  o New function 'genNLR()' was added to generate scored (binary) data with\n    model by 'difNLR'.\n\n\nMINOR UPDATES\n\n  o  Several typos were fixed.\n",
