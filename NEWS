----------------------------------------
- Changes in difNLR 1.0.7 (2017-08-10) -
----------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o Item purification was implemented into 'ddfMLR()' function.
  o Anchor items were implemented into 'ddfMLR()' function.
  o Anchor items were implemented into 'MLR()' function.

MINOR UPDATES

  o Minor bug in 'logLik.ddfMLR()' function was fixed.
  o Documentation of 'difNLR()' was updated.

----------------------------------------
- Changes in difNLR 1.0.6 (2017-08-09) -
----------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o Item purification was implemented into 'difNLR()' function.
  o Anchor items were implemented into 'difNLR()' function.
  o Anchor items were implemented into 'NLR()' function.

MINOR UPDATES

  o README file was updated.

----------------------------------------
- Changes in difNLR 1.0.5 (2017-08-09) -
----------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o Datasets 'difMedical', 'difMedicaltest' and 'difMedicalkey'
    were renamed. Now they are 'MSATB', 'MSATBtest' and 'MSATBkey'
    from Medical School Admission Test in Biology.


MINOR UPDATES

  o LazyData is now available.
  o References were updated.
  o README file updated.

----------------------------------------
- Changes in difNLR 1.0.4 (2017-08-08) -
----------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o New function 'formulaNLR()' was implemented. Function
    returns formula for NLR model for 11 predefined models and 4
    predefined DIF types to test. Model and DIF type can be also
    specified with constraints on parameters a, b, c and d.
  o Function 'NLR()' now handles 11 predefined models and 4
    predefined DIF types to test. Model and DIF type can be also
    specified with constraints on parameters a, b, c and d.
  o Function 'startNLR()' was edited to return starting
    parameters with different parameterization. It was also mildly
    changed to correspond to new version of 'NLR()' function.
  o Function 'difNLR()' can now handle also total score or other
    user-specified matching score.
  o Function 'constrNLR()' is no longer part of the 'difNLR'
    package.


MINOR UPDATES

  o References were updated.
  o Some minor bugs were fixed:
      - Items are no longer renamed by 'difNLR()' and 'ddfMLR()' functions.
      - Starting values are now correctly checked in 'difNLR()' function.
  o 'msm' package is now used for delta method in 'difNLR()' function

----------------------------------------
- Changes in difNLR 1.0.3 (2017-06-15) -
----------------------------------------

*** THIS IS A CRAN VERSION ***

MAJOR UPDATES

  o Bug of 'plot.ddfMLR()' for non-uniform DDF was fixed.
  o References were updated.

----------------------------------------
- Changes in difNLR 1.0.2 (2017-06-06) -
----------------------------------------

*** THIS IS A CRAN VERSION ***

MAJOR UPDATES

  o Bug of dimensions for parameter estimates of 'difNLR()'
    function was fixed.
  o Datasets 'GMAT' and 'GMATtest' were extended by 'criterion'
    variable which is intended to be predicted by test.
  o 'coef', 'logLik', 'AIC' and 'BIC' S3 methods were added for
    class 'ddfMLR'.

MINOR UPDATES

  o  Functions 'plot.ddfMLR()' and 'plot.difNLR()' were slightly
     improved.
  o  Updated error and warning handling in 'difNLR()' and 'ddfMLR()'
     functions.
  o  Description file was updated.
  o  Item names are now the same as in original data set.
  o  Readme file updated.

----------------------------------------
- Changes in difNLR 1.0.0 (2017-01-10) -
----------------------------------------

*** THIS IS A CRAN VERSION ***

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  New function ddfMLR() to detect Differential Distractor
     Functioning (DDF) with Multinomial Log-linear Regression
     (MLR) model.
     S3 methods for class 'ddfMLR' also added - 'print' and 'plot'.

  o  New function MLR() to calculate likelihood ratio statistic
     for detecting DDF with MLR model.

  o  The 'difNLR()' function can handle 6 generalized logistic
     regression models with option 'model'.

  o  Functions 'startNLR()', 'genNLR()' ans S3 methods for class
     'difNLR' were changed according 'difNLR()' function. S3 method
     'coef' was created.

  o  New functions NLR() and constrNLR() can now calculates DIF
     detection statistics and specify constraints for generalized
     logistic regression model.

  o  Function 'difNLR()' was edited to response to 'difR' package
     and its DIF detection functions.

  o  Function 'genNLR()' was changed to generate dataset from
     generalized logistic regression model with 8 parameters.

MINOR UPDATES

  o  The CITATION file was updated.

  o  Several typos were fixed.

  o  Some default options of input were changed.

  o  'AIC()', 'BIC()' and 'logLik()' S3 methods added to 'difNLR()'

----------------------------------------
- Changes in difNLR 0.2.0 (2016-11-09) -
----------------------------------------

*** THIS IS A CRAN VERSION ***

MAJOR UPDATES

  o S3 method 'plot' for class 'difNLR' was updated.

  o New option of 'test' in 'difNLR()' function was added. Possible
    choices are now 'F' for F-test and 'LR' for likelihood ratio test.

  o Choice of significant level 'alpha' was added into 'difNLR()'
    function with default option 0.05.

  o Six new data sets were added - scored 'GMAT' data, its unscored version
    'GMATtest' and its key 'GMATkey'. Scored 'difMedical' data set, its
    unscored version 'difMedicaltest' and key 'difMedicalkey'.

  o New function 'genNLR()' was added to generate scored (binary) data with
    model by 'difNLR'.

MINOR UPDATES

  o  Several typos were fixed.
