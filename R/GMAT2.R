#' Dichotomous Data Set Based on Graduate Management Admission Test
#'
#' @description The \code{GMAT2} data set is generated data set based on parameters from Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) data set (Kingston et al., 1985). First two items were considered to function differently in uniform and non-uniform way respectively. The data set represents responses of 1,000 subjects to multiple-choice test of 20 items. A correct answer is coded as 1 and incorrect answer as 0. The column \code{group} represents group membership, where 0 represents reference group and 1 represents focal group. Groups are the same size (i.e. 500 per group).
