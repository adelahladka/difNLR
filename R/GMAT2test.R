#' Data Set Based on Graduate Management Admission Test
#'
#' @description The \code{GMAT2test} data set is generated data set based on parameters from Graduate Management
#' Admission Test (GMAT) data set (Kingston et al., 1985). First two items were considered to function differently
#' in uniform and non-uniform way respectively. The data set represents responses of 1,000 subjects to
#' multiple-choice test of 20 items. Aditionally, 4 possible answers on all items were generated,
#' coded A, B, C and D. The column \code{group} represents group membership, where 0 represents reference group
#' and 1 represent focal group. Groups are the same size (i.e. 500 per group).
