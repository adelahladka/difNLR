# difNLR 1.0.4 (2017-08-08)

## Major updates
  * New function `formulaNLR()` was implemented. Function
    returns formula for NLR model for 11 predefined models and 4
    predefined DIF types to test. Model and DIF type can be also
    specified with constraints on parameters a, b, c and d.
  * Function `NLR()` now handles 11 predefined models and 4
    predefined DIF types to test. Model and DIF type can be also
    specified with constraints on parameters a, b, c and d.
  * Function `startNLR()` was edited to return starting
    parameters with different parameterization. It was also mildly
    changed to correspond to new version of `NLR()` function.
  * Function `difNLR()` can now handle also total score or other
    user-specified matching score.
  * Function `constrNLR()` is no longer part of the `difNLR`
    package.

## Minor updates
  * References were updated.
  * Some minor bugs were fixed:
      - Items are no longer renamed by `difNLR()` and `ddfMLR()` functions.
      - Starting values are now correctly checked in `difNLR()` function.
  * `msm` package is now used for delta method in `difNLR()` function.

  * Functions `plot.ddfMLR()` and `plot.difNLR()` were slightly improved.
  * Updated error and warning handling in `difNLR()` and `ddfMLR()` functions.
  * Description file was updated.
  * Item names are now the same as in original data set.
  * README file updated.

------

# difNLR 1.0.0 (2017-01-10)

**_THIS IS A CRAN VERSION_**

## Major updates
  * New function `ddfMLR()` to detect Differential Distractor Functioning (DDF) with Multinomial Log-linear Regression (MLR) model. S3 methods for class `ddfMLR` also added - `print` and `plot`.
  * New function `MLR()` to calculate likelihood ratio statistic
     for detecting DDF with MLR model.
  * The `difNLR()` function can handle 6 generalized logistic
     regression models with option `model`.
